        quotes[0] = "Capricorns are obsessed with chasing success. They are one of the most disciplined, hardworking signs of the zodiac. Some people might even consider them workaholics because they devote so much of their time and energy into reaching their goals. They tend to value their career over their social life, but that is because they have a thirst for knowledge. They love puzzles and problem solving. They would rather be working at their desk than spend the weekend stuck in a crowded bar.";
        sources[0] = " ";

        quotes[1] = "Capricorns never give up on their goals. They don’t allow obstacles to restrict them because they understand nothing great can be accomplished without hard work. They are wise enough to understand that reaching their dreams isn’t going to be easy. After all, they are realists. They know what they are getting themselves into ahead of time. However, they don’t let their fears slow them down. They are persistent, detail-oriented, and analytical. This is why they make excellent accountants, bankers, and business executives.";
        sources[1] = " ";

        quotes[2] = "Capricorns are practical, independent, and self-reliant. They enjoy doing useful things around the house and will normally be involved in several DIY projects at once. Since Capricorns are so hard working, they even spend their free time trying to better themselves. They will read plenty of books, especially nonfiction, so that they can be knowledgeable about as many different subjects as possible. They want to know everything there is about the world and never feel like they have researched enough.";
        sources[2] = " ";

        quotes[3] = "Capricorns can seem cold and uncompassionate when you first meet them. However, deep down, they are loyal, dependable, and devoted. They simply have high walls. They might need to spend years with someone before they feel comfortable opening up about their emotions. They only have a few close friends – but they will stay friends for life. They are also incredibly close with their families and value traditions that they will pass down to their own children. Capricorns keep themselves closed off to most of the world, so if they let you inside, they value you immensely.";
        sources[3] = " ";

        quotes[4] = "Capricorns are natural born leaders. They are responsible, mature, good at keeping track of things and have good memories. This makes them skilled at running a team. However, they tend to clash with authority. They want to be the ones in charge. They want to do things their way. Sometimes they can come across as condescending because they think they know better than everyone around them. They assume they are the wisest one in the room – and to their credit, they are usually right.";
        sources[4] = " ";

        quotes[5] = "Capricorns have a hard time staying present. They don’t know how to live in the moment because they are always worried about how they messed up yesterday or how they are going to improve themselves tomorrow. Sometimes they overlook the biggest blessings in their life because they are too focused on what they don’t have and what they haven’t accomplished. Since they are perfectionists, they don’t handle failure well. When they make one tiny mistake, they will think about it for weeks. They will literally lose sleep over it.";
        sources[5] = " ";

        quotes[6] = "Capricorns hold their family, friends, and coworkers to incredibly high standards. However, they also hold themselves to those standards. They are their own biggest critics. They are never satisfied with themselves. Of course, even though they beat themselves up all the time, they don’t tolerate it when other people are rude to them. They will not forgive and forget when someone betrays them. They will cut contact immediately, and since they think with their heads instead of their hearts, walking away won’t bother them in the least. ";
        sources[6] = " ";

        quotes[7] = "Capricorns live by the rules. They aren’t nearly as impulsive as some other signs. They have an impressive amount of self-control know and know how to successfully ignore their urges. They are not going to allow the temptation to ruin their career, their relationship, or their friendships. They think through every option presented to them thoroughly before coming to a decision and weigh the consequences of each action. They never act in the heat of the moment. They give it some thought.";
        sources[7] = " ";

        quotes[8] = "Capricorns don’t yearn for an exciting life filled with adventure and spontaneity. They would rather live a stable, predictable life. They would rather know that they are in a financially, physically, and emotionally safe space. Although the only thing they want out of life is stability, they aren’t going to feel comfortable even when they’re doing well for themselves. They are pessimists at heart. They always assume something is going to go terribly wrong. They can never enjoy a good moment because they assume a horrible one is right around the corner.";
        sources[8] = " ";

        quotes[9] = "Capricorns are surprisingly sensitive. They get insulted easily and cannot handle criticism well. Of course, they would never let you see their vulnerable side. They act stoic when they are in public. They pretend that nothing bothers them. They pretend that they don’t care about anyone other than themselves. Capricorns only cry behind closed doors. They don’t trust most people enough to get emotional in front of them. It takes a long time for them to show someone else their big heart.";
        sources[9] = " ";

        quotes[10] = "Capricorns seem quiet when you first meet them because they aren’t interested in small talk. They get bored talking about superficial things like sports, the weather, or celebrity gossip. They prefer more intellectually stimulating conversations. Plus, they are very selective when it comes to the people they allow into their inner circle. They aren’t really looking to add more numbers to their phone. They would rather have a small group of friends they can trust than a large group of friends who hardly know them at all.";
        sources[10] = " ";

        quotes[11] = "Capricorns care much more about their success at work than their reputations at parties. They will do anything in order to reach their goals. They are willing to make sacrifices, both big and small, in order to reach the top of the career ladder. They will sacrifice their time, their social life, and even their sanity in order to achieve their dreams. They won’t let anything stop them from reaching their intended destination. They are not quitters.";
        sources[11] = " ";

        quotes[12] = "Capricorns are surprisingly materialistic. Even though they couldn’t care less about the way other people perceive them, they enjoy buying the newest phones and cars and clothing because it makes them feel successful. It makes them feel like they have accomplished something worthwhile. It is a physical reward of all the hard work they put into their career each and every day. It helps them remind themselves that they are doing well.";
        sources[12] = " ";

        quotes[13] = "Capricorns aren’t the most romantic sign. However, they make amazing partners because they are consistent. When they’re in a committed relationship, they will make sure their partner feels safe, secure, and loved. Of course, since they are so private, they aren’t into PDA. They aren’t going to perform any grand gestures on anniversaries in order to prove their love, either. Instead, they are going to make small gestures every single day. They are going to make sure their partner understands they are appreciated every day of the year, not only on special occasions.";
        sources[13] = " ";

        quotes[14] = "Capricorn men value loyalty above all else — and they aren’t hypocrites. They will stay faithful to you in return. They have no interest in playing the field, so once they are committed, they consider you their partner for life. That is why they will always be honest with you. Even when they are telling you something that is hard to hear, they won’t sugarcoat it. They will make sure you know the whole truth because they respect you too much to lie to you.";
        sources[14] = " ";

        quotes[15] = "Although Capricorn men are honest and trustworthy, they might not consider you their top priority at all times. They tend to care much more about their careers than their relationships and have no problem sacrificing love for success. They need a grounded, practical partner who won’t mind if they spend long hours at work instead of putting energy into planning date nights. Remember, even when they are deeply in love, Capricorn men never show their emotions openly. Their sweet gestures can be very subtle.";
        sources[15] = " ";

        quotes[16] = "Capricorn women are self-sufficient. They can handle themselves. They don’t need a partner to take care of them, to pamper them, to rescue them. They need a partner who understands they don’t need a knight in shining armor. They need an equal. They need a friend. They need someone who can hold intellectual conversations with them and challenge them on a daily basis. Above all, they need someone who is going to stay loyal.";
        sources[16] = " ";

        quotes[17] = "Capricorn women never rush into relationships. They aren’t afraid of making the first move — but they are going to wait until they are one-hundred percent sure you are a good match for them. They don’t want to waste their time on the wrong person, so they are going to take all of your actions into consideration. They are going to study you for months and evaluate your treatment of them. This is because they would rather stay single and focus on their career than get into a relationship that is going to distract them from that career.";
        sources[17] = " ";

        quotes[18] = "The Capricorn zodiac sign will do whatever they need to do to achieve success, especially career-wise. This zodiac is ruled by Saturn, the planet of restrictions, and with the chains depicted in the card and the feelings of being trapped or stuck, a Capricorn might often feel restricted in some way, even though there is always the opportunity of freedom that they’ll strive for.";
        sources[18] = " ";

        quotes[19] = "The Capricorn symbol is a mythological creature known as a sea goat. The goat hoof represents making plans and achieving success, while the fish tail represents imagination, creativity, and productivity. The goat climbs and climbs, even in the worst environments — Capricorns are known to keep going until they’ve reached their goals.";
