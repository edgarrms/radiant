        quotes[0] = "Like crabs, Cancers are protected by their rough outer shells. They don’t let anyone inside until they know the other person can be trusted. This can cause them to come across as cold, distant, and unfeeling at first. However, they are only trying to protect themselves. They know they are emotional and want to create a barrier between them and anyone who could cause them harm. It takes them a long time to open up to others, but once they feel comfortable, they are warm and inviting.";
        sources[0] = " ";

        quotes[1] = "As the sign of womanhood, Cancers are naturally nurturing with strong maternal instincts. They are caregivers who consistently offer their loved ones emotional support. They will do a favor for someone in need at any time and they always keep their promises. Overall, they pay more attention to the happiness of other people than their own happiness. However, since they care so deeply about the people in their life, they are overprotective when it comes to their friends and family. Sometimes, this can come across as overbearing.";
        sources[1] = " ";

        quotes[2] = "Cancers lead with their emotions. They are highly sensitive to their environments and the people surrounding them in a space. They can easily pick up on the energy in the room and the shift change in someone’s tone of voice. They are highly intuitive – and highly emotional. They get upset easily and they aren’t afraid to cry. They wear their emotions on their sleeves.";
        sources[2] = " ";

        quotes[3] = "Overall, Cancers listen to their hearts over their heads. They do not always behave rationally. Sometimes, they will allow their emotions to win out and will do whatever feels right instead of going with the decision that makes the most logical sense. Because they base their decisions on feelings, they can act impulsively and irrationally. They can make decisions that feel right to them in the moment and then end up regretting them later.";
        sources[3] = " ";

        quotes[4] = "Cancers are sometimes considered crabby because of their frequent mood swings. They can switch from being happy to upset in an instant because they are sensitive and insecure. The smallest, most harmless comment can cause them to spiral when they take it the wrong way. They are always on the defensive. They are always assuming the worst about the way others view them.";
        sources[4] = " ";

        quotes[5] = "Cancers aren’t a fan of direct conflict and confrontation, but they are masters of passive-aggressive behavior. When they are upset with you, they are going to make little comments here and there to express their discomfort. They are going to make it clear they are unhappy with the way you’ve been acting by slamming doors and being rough with dishes. They aren’t going to come right out and say what’s been bothering them, but you can definitely tell when they’re in a sour mood.";
        sources[5] = " ";

        quotes[6] = "Cancers have wild, vivid imaginations. Because of their innate creativity, they have a knack for the arts. They tend to find peace through poetry, music, art, or any other form of creation. These activities provide them with the perfect outlet to release their emotions, so they do not explode with anger or collapse into tears. It also gives them a way to start making sense of the human experience, which is something on their mind often.";
        sources[6] = " ";

        quotes[7] = "Cancers, like all water elements, are shaped by their relationships with others. It is necessary for them to surround themselves with the right people because they are going to be strongly influenced by the ones they spend the most time alongside. Although they are social creatures, they tend to retreat into their shells when they are overwhelmed. Plus, they usually fall on the introverted side, so they can feel uncomfortable in large groups.";
        sources[7] = " ";

        quotes[8] = "Cancers have a tendency to overreact whenever something small goes wrong – but they also overreact when they are met with positive news. When they are in a good mood, they feel like they’re on top of the world. When they are in a bad mood, they feel like the world is ending. Since their emotions are so extreme — and so noticeable — it can make them come across as moody. Some people might also consider them downers because they complain often. Although they are good with people, they also assume the worst of people. They are naturally pessimistic. They can’t help themselves from whining, even when it isn’t much wrong in their world.";
        sources[8] = " ";

        quotes[9] = "Despite their negativity, Cancers make wonderful friends, because they are sympathetic when it comes to other people’s feelings. They are not going to judge anyone who opens up to them. They will listen to a friend talk for hours without saying a word themselves. Since they are nurturers at heart, they will let loved ones cry on their shoulder. They will give advice, give hugs, and give encouragement to help others through their darkest moments.";
        sources[9] = " ";

        quotes[10] = "Cancers rely on gut feelings to lead them through life. Luckily, they are skilled when it comes to reading people. This is helpful since they have such a strong fear of being deceived by family members and friends that they thought they could trust. Although they form strong attachments to the people who matter to them, they do not hesitate to cut people out of their lives. It tends to be easier to walk away than to forgive.";
        sources[10] = " ";

        quotes[11] = "Cancers have a hard time moving on from bad things that have happened in the past. They will hold a grudge for a long period of time. Even if they forgive you on the surface, they will never forget what you have put them through and will use your mistakes as ammo in arguments down the line. Although Cancers are sweet, you do not want to be on their bad side. They can be surprisingly manipulative. They know when to use tears to get their way and can always come up with the perfect comment to dig beneath someone’s skin.";
        sources[11] = " ";

        quotes[12] = "Cancers aren’t only overprotective when it comes to their family and friends. They are also protective when it comes to their home. This sign desires peace, stability, and comfort above all else. They want to have a place where they can go at the end of each night and feel safe. A place that belongs entirely to them. They will do whatever is possible in order to give themselves this type of consistency, whether that means working hard at a job that doesn’t bring them any joy or staying in the wrong relationship for a little too long.";
        sources[12] = " ";

        quotes[13] = "Cancers aren’t the most practical zodiac sign. They are dreamers. They are visionaries. They are open-minded, adaptable, and free-spirited. Although they are hard workers, they pay more attention to the imaginary future in their minds than their current reality. They also have a tendency to romanticize relationships, which can either bring them extreme happiness or backfire on them completely. Unfortunately, despite their ability to read people, this means they are highly susceptible to toxic relationships.";
        sources[13] = " ";

        quotes[14] = "Cancers might seem standoffish at first because they are cautious of new people. Plus, they aren’t the biggest fans of small talk and can get overwhelmed during social gatherings. They prefer smaller, tightknit groups and trust their intuition. They can instantly tell whether they’ve walked into a bad situation. They can instantly tell whether they want to get to know you better or stay far, far away. However, if you’re lucky enough to earn their trust, they will seem like a completely different person who is engaging, open-minded, and supportive";
        sources[14] = " ";

        quotes[15] = "Although they are known as moody, most of the time Cancers tend to turn their emotions inward because they don’t want to bother anyone. They want others to have a good time and don’t want to be the reason why their loved ones are worried. When they fly into a rage, it can seem like they’ve erupted out of nowhere because they’ve kept quiet for such a long time. They’ve bottled up their emotions until they had no choice but to explode.";
        sources[15] = " ";

        quotes[16] = "Although Cancer men build walls to keep out strangers, they will let their partner see the worst sides of them. They won’t bother to hide their insecurities. They will be completely honest about their fears for the future and their past mistakes. Since they plan on remaining with their partner for life, they don’t hold anything back from them. They reveal the truth, however ugly or uncomfortable it may be to share.";
        sources[16] = " ";

        quotes[17] = "Cancer men are truthful, generous, and sentimental. They would rather be given a gift that holds emotional significance than given an expensive material item. Cancer men don’t need anything fancy in order to feel loved. At the end of the day, they only want to feel needed. They want to feel like they are providing their partner with everything they need, whether that is financially, physically, or emotionally.";
        sources[17] = " ";

        quotes[18] = "Once a Cancer woman grows attached to you, she will consider you a lifelong companion. She will remain loyal for as long as you continue treating her with love and respect. Cancer women are not really interested in playing the field. She would rather be committed to one partner who treats her well than bounce from person to person. Casual relationships don’t hold much appeal to her. However, because of her desire to create a stable home, these women can sometimes become codependent and clingy. She can also grow resentful if she believes she is putting more effort into the relationship than her partner. She needs constant reassurance, attention, validation, so she knows you are still madly in love with her. If she is not given proper appreciation, there is a chance she could stray.";
        sources[18] = " ";

        quotes[19] = "If you have a child who was born under the Cancer zodiac, keep in mind the main personality trait you’ll have to acknowledge, appreciate, and understand: emotional. Cancerian children will be needier than the other zodiac babies; they’ll appreciate physical touch more than the others will so keep them close to you! They’ll also be big cry babies, so just be patient and understanding and offer an ear to listen and a shoulder to cry on when they need it. As the Cancer zodiac child gets older, they might still be incredibly emotional all the time but will also put you through their rollercoaster of emotions.";
