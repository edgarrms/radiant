        quotes[0] = "The Aquarius symbol is a water bearer, representing the flow of energy. This constellation looks like two ocean waves and represents an Aquarius energy and flow of progressive, forward-thinking. “Aquarius”, in Latin, means “water-carrier”, which makes sense because this constellation is surrounded by other constellations with water attributes, like Pisces (the fish) and Cetus (the whale). The Aquarius symbol can be found in the northern hemisphere in the winter months and in the southern hemisphere during the spring months.";
        sources[0] = "Patrick Algrim";

        quotes[1] = "In Greek mythology, Ganymede, a young prince, was tending to sheep one day when Zeus spotted him and took him to be his servant. He wanted Ganymede to be his cup-bearer, always serving him with water and wine of the gods. After some time, Ganymede had enough – he refused to continue to do this and so he poured out all of the drinks to fall to earth. And if you have an Aquarius in your life, you know that they can be quite rebellious and independent like Ganymede.";
        sources[1] = "Patrick Algrim";

        quotes[2] = "The Aquarius zodiac sign is represented by The Star, the Tarot card that represents inspiration, peace, hope, and promising opportunities. It depicts a woman pouring water into water and into the earth with one foot in the water and one foot on land. This card represents how this star sign provides nourishment, hope, and peace for the future. If you receive this card, you are being guided in the right direction and towards hope, peace, and healing.";
        sources[2] = "Patrick Algrim";

        quotes[3] = "Aquarius want to change the world. They have hope that tomorrow is going to be better than today – but they aren’t blindly optimistic that things will change. They actively try to enact change. They are humanitarians with a strong sense of justice who believe everyone deserves peace, comfort, and safety. This sign tries their hardest to make a positive impact on the world every single day, even if it means they are helping one person at a time.";
        sources[3] = "Patrick Algrim";

        quotes[4] = "Since Aquarius are dreamers with one foot on water and one foot on land, they can get distracted easily. They live in their own head. They commonly get swept away by daydreams and forget to pay attention to the person in front of them. This can make them come across as aloof, even though they care much more about others than they care about themselves. Their main goal in life is to help others and fight for causes they believe in.";
        sources[4] = "Patrick Algrim";

        quotes[5] = "Aquarius are highly intelligent. They are deep, philosophical thinkers who won’t walk away when something goes wrong. Since they love to problem solve, they will find a way to fix the issue instead of giving up hope. Even when times are tough, they never lose faith in humanity or themselves. They are not quitters. They are persistent, dedicated, and passionate about everything they set their heart on doing. They won’t walk away from a cause that matters to them. They’ll have to be dragged away.";
        sources[5] = "Patrick Algrim";

        quotes[6] = "Aquarius are shy when you first meet them, but once they open up to you, they are friendly, accepting, and fun. They make wonderful, lifelong friends because they are open-minded and good at listening to opinions that differ from their own. While they go with the flow at parties, they can also hold weighty conversations about deep topics. However, they will only act emotionally intimate with people they can trust, so they aren’t going to be uncensored around you until they know you well.";
        sources[6] = "Patrick Algrim";

        quotes[7] = "Aquarius are free spirits. Although they have a wide circle of friends, they tend to consider themselves loners. This is because they won’t change their morals or lower their standards in order to please anyone. They will stubbornly stick to their beliefs, even if it costs them friendships. Since they value justice more than individual relationships, they try not to grow too attached to anyone. They try to rely on themselves.";
        sources[7] = "Patrick Algrim";

        quotes[8] = "Some people might consider Aquarius eccentric because of their strong sense of self. They don’t care about fitting in with their peers. They will wear what they want and fight for what they want without worrying about how it looks to the outside world. Plus, they aren’t afraid to rebel and go against the status quo when they feel like the rest of the world is wrong. They embrace their uniqueness instead of being embarrassed by it.";
        sources[8] = "Patrick Algrim";

        quotes[9] = "Aquarius are able to adapt to new environments quickly. They don’t sweat the small stuff and are able to go with the flow when faced with unexpected circumstances. Since they are so flexible, and since they are such skilled problem solvers, they are able to handle anything that is thrown at them. They don’t get stressed whenever something small goes wrong, the way that other signs might. They are able to look at the big picture instead of getting distracted by every little speedbump.";
        sources[9] = "Patrick Algrim";

        quotes[10] = "Although Aquarius need alone time every once in a while, so they can recharge, they won’t want to be alone for long periods of time. This is partially because they feel their emotions in extremes. When they are happy, they feel like everything is right with the world. However, when they are lonely, they feel like the world is falling apart and they will never experience happiness again. Although they pride themselves on being analytical, their emotions can make it hard for them to think logically in times of distress.";
        sources[10] = "Patrick Algrim";

        quotes[11] = "Aquarius don’t like to be tied down. They need a certain amount of freedom and privacy, even when they are in serious relationships. Otherwise, they are going to feel like their potential is being limited. They also need to be challenged by their partners. They will get bored if they aren’t stimulated mentally. They need to date someone who will have fun with them but will also discuss important issues with them and make sure they are constantly growing.";
        sources[11] = "Patrick Algrim";

        quotes[12] = "Aquarius have a hard time expressing their emotions. They keep their guard high because they are reluctant to open up to anyone who might betray their trust. However, once they get to know you better, they are going to let you see their vulnerable side. Although they have a hard time expressing emotions, they communicate well when it comes to their ideas. In fact, they work better in teams than on their own because they thrive on community. They love being around other people.";
        sources[12] = "Patrick Algrim";

        quotes[13] = "Aquarius are visionaries with a strong sense of self. They know exactly what they want out of life and will not stop until their dreams become a reality. They are persistent and passionate, so they do not allow minor inconveniences to set them off their path. It’s easy for them to stand by their values because those values do not change. They are stubborn and set in their ways.";
        sources[13] = "Patrick Algrim";

        quotes[14] = "Aquarius can come across as unreliable because they’re so unpredictable. It’s hard to tell what they are thinking or what they’re about to say next in a conversation. Of course, their free-spirited attitude is why they’re so laid-back all the time. They couldn’t care less about the opinions of others. Aquarius aren’t going to go out of their way in order to fit in with the crowd because they would rather stand out. They would rather be unique and quirky.";
        sources[14] = "Patrick Algrim";

        quotes[15] = "Friendship is incredibly important to an Aquarius. They don’t want to get into a relationship with someone unless they connect with that person on an emotional level as well as a physical one. If they are going to be spending most of their time with this person, they want to be able to have deep, meaningful conversations that go deeper than the surface level. They want to be challenged, and stimulated, intellectually. Otherwise, the bond is never going to last.";
        sources[15] = "Patrick Algrim";

        quotes[16] = "Before getting into a relationship with an Aquarius, you should be aware of their stubborn side. Although they are open-minded when it comes to listening to diverse opinions from friends, family, and strangers, they know what they personally want. They know what they believe. They have a strict set of morals that aren’t up for debate. You are not going to be able to change their mind overnight. They are going to stick to their opinions.";
        sources[16] = "Patrick Algrim";

        quotes[17] = "You’re a decisive individual. You know what you want and you’ll go get it — you’ll be a leader even if you don’t have many followers.";
        sources[17] = "Patrick Algrim";

        quotes[18] = "You are quite unpredictable; although you can be social, you’ll also just disappear and leave when you’re not in the mood anymore. This is your free-spirit energy!";
        sources[18] = "Patrick Algrim";

        quotes[19] = "You are known to have a strange or “otherworldly” personality because of your innovative ideas and strong desire to rebel and seek change in all aspects of life.";
        sources[19] = "Patrick Algrim";
