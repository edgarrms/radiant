        quotes[0] = "A Taurus is the best representation of growth and development in the whole of the Zodiac. This is why Taureans are often considered to be very rooted and earthy nurturers. They are highly caring, and compassionate.";
        sources[0] = " ";

        quotes[1] = "Every Taurus needs harmony in their life. They are constantly concerned with making everything around them pleasurable and lovely to look at. They are deeply material, and their happiness relies on possessions and security in their lifestyle. A Taurus’ need for harmony often causes them to be quite flexible, though they are known for being extremely stubborn. They often struggle to find a balance, but their internal quest for simplicity helps for them to find symmetry in their personality";
        sources[1] = " ";

        quotes[2] = "As a very airy and changeable individual, a Taurus often struggles to find their autonomy. It is very important for them to develop independence, and to learn how to take care of themselves without the help of others. In order to do so, a Taurus must understand that the world does not revolve around them, and that they cannot always be the center of attention. They have to learn how to develop healthy habits alone.";
        sources[2] = " ";

        quotes[3] = "A Taurus will never say no to indulging in the most physical matters. They enjoy food deeply, are very sexual creatures, and enjoy sports. However, they do not crave constant activity, often needing to recharge and relax after a long day. Sometimes, a Taurus will prefer to stay home, where things are comfortable and familiar and simple.";
        sources[3] = " ";

        quotes[4] = "A Taurus boasts strong observational skills. They have the ability to map out, strategize, and solve problems or implement plans. However, they are known to procrastinate, because they do not always need to be in action. Finding a balance between relaxing and working extremely hard is often a struggle for a Taurus, as they love both sides equally, but do not crave them at the same time. It is either action or inaction, work or comfort.";
        sources[4] = " ";

        quotes[5] = "A natural born team leader, a Taurus enjoys team work when they are in charge and have the ability to add individual touches to the project. They are dominant, and fight back urges to lead when they are not in a position that allows them to do so. Their stubborn nature is combative here, and they will often argue until things are done their way.";
        sources[5] = " ";

        quotes[6] = "Taureans can be considered quite selfish due to their stubbornness and their strong beliefs. They always protect their own interests above anything else, as to ensure their comfort. However, they are highly intuitive, and can be people pleasers because of that. They take it to heart when they see people who need a compassionate hand, and will always live for the people they care about.";
        sources[6] = " ";

        quotes[7] = "A Taurus is very indulgent, creative, and lazy. They are best suited for someone who doesn’t mind relaxing and staying in a few nights a week, while still catering to their creativity and physicality. A Cancer is an amazing match for a Taurus, because they will relate to a Taureans need for security and deep, serious relationships. A Cancer is also an empath who is compassionate, so they will appreciate and love a Taurus’ sensitivity and need for emotionality";
        sources[7] = " ";

        quotes[8] = "In a relationship, a Taurean is very traditional in the sense that they will love going out on dates. However, they are also homebodies, so a lot of your time will be spent cuddling up to them in bed and watching movie marathons with them on the couch. A Taurus will fight to maintain a good relationship, and will put in a lot of effort when it comes to someone they love. A Taurus will make you feel secure and cared for in a relationship, and will always fight to protect your heart and your feelings. However, they can be stubborn, so it is very important to nurture good communication early on, as to ensure the easily hurt bull doesn’t get offended or guarded when you bring up something that disappointed you or made you angry.";
        sources[8] = " ";

        quotes[9] = "A Taurus loves the finer things in life, and also adores going out to eat or try new beverages. Therefore, taking them on a wine tasting or a beer tasting would be an absolutely wonderful date. Tasting wine, eating delicious food, and enjoying the environment around them will appeal to every sensual side of the Taurus, while complimenting their need for physical stimulation as well.";
        sources[9] = " ";

        quotes[10] = "A Taurus is quite harmonized in bed. They tend to be very sensual and deep, but they can also be very direct and dominant. If they had to choose, they would always pick “making love” rather than just having sex or getting the deed over with. They want to feel loved in bed, and refuse to hook up casually. They adore neck kisses, deep embraces, closeness and romance in the bedroom, and are known to be very sexually charged, magnetic lovers.";
        sources[10] = " ";

        quotes[11] = "A Taurus hates change. They absolutely despise it. If they have been in a relationship for a long time, it will also take a long time for them to get accustomed to being single again. They will often suffer from extreme insecurity and hurt when they have their heart broken, feeling unworthy of love during the healing process. However, Taureans have a way of putting up a very deceiving front, and will often keep all of their sad and dark feelings inside of them in order to maintain their nonchalance. Taureans often suffer from heartbreak behind closed doors, and they can feel so intensely that they shut down completely when rejected or mourning the loss of love.";
        sources[11] = " ";

        quotes[12] = "When you have a Taurus as a best friend, they are the perfect travel buddy. They will never say no to a road trip of a fun little beach vacation. A Taurus will bring to your friendship their calm nature, and they will give the best advice. Their ambition and their creativity will inspire you, and ignite your passions. The great thing about a Taurean best friend is that they will appreciate you and accept you for your faults, rather than judging you for them.";
        sources[12] = " ";

        quotes[13] = "The most impressive thing for a Taurus is someone who is simply just honest and real. They hate fake people. They love reliable presences in their life, and will respect those who are not flakey. Gain huge points with a Taurus by letting them do their thing, at their own pace — they hate to be rushed, and really appreciate people who let them take their time.";
        sources[13] = " ";

        quotes[14] = "A Taurus will never blow up on you right away. When mad, they will often give you subtle, passive aggressive hints. They will become silent and cold, keeping everything in until it boils over and causes them to explode with emotions. Physical creatures, they often use their body a lot, pacing and waving their hands, exhausting themselves in an angry fit. However, it is very hard to upset a Taurus, as they tend to be rational and just don’t want to disturb any harmony.";
        sources[14] = " ";

        quotes[15] = "When sad a Taurus will isolate themselves. They will turn to binge eating and sleeping, and they will always play the victim in any situation. This allows for them to further turn into their comforts, and justify their descent into negative indulgence.";
        sources[15] = " ";

        quotes[16] = "A Taurus is happiest when they are eating good food. A simple night in with someone they love, eating treats and watching movies, is something they cherish.";
        sources[16] = " ";

        quotes[17] = "A Taurus holds within them extraordinary potential, and they are extremely strong individuals. They take life as it comes, and always find a way to roll with the punches. They are kind, very friendly, intelligent, funny creatures who hold within them a rare and beautiful sensitivity. They are revered by many different groups of people and are impressively creative.";
        sources[17] = " ";

        quotes[18] = "A Taurus has a tendency to deny any and all responsibility when it comes to tough situations or problems. They never want to deal with anything, and will ignore their faults. A Taurus also doesn’t have a very strong backbone when it comes to sticking up for themselves, so they will try to get out of issues to avoid conflict. This causes a lot of anxiety for them, and creates more problems in the long run because they are always taking the easy way out.";
        sources[18] = " ";

        quotes[19] = "A Taurus is very grounded and reliable, they crave harmony in their life. Therefore, they are terrified of being outside of their comfort zone, and they fear inconsistency the way some people fear physical things like snakes or spiders. The idea of being challenged comfort wise causes acute problems for a bull, like chest pain, and emotional meltdowns.";
        sources[19] = " ";

        quotes[20] = "A Taurus is a very steadfast and stable human being. They work extremely hard when it comes to guaranteed payoffs like vacations, benefits, and great job security and salaries. They are determined, honest, and patient when they need to be, and they have a great approach to solving problems. Dependable and great leaders, Taureans would make amazing educators, lawyers, and designers. Because they are creative and love material things, they are often known to be very successful working with food, jewelry and other luxury items.";
        sources[20] = " ";

        quotes[21] = "Ruled by the throat, Taureans often suffer from throat infections, goiters and problems with their thyroid.";
        sources[21] = " ";

        quotes[22] = "An ideal vacation for a Taurus involves comfort. They need to be pampered, taken care of, and they also need to experience delicious food and beautiful surroundings. Taking your Taurus to wine country and booking out a swanky hotel room, complete with spa and room service, would be an amazing vacation idea because it compliments every aspect of a Taurean personality";
        sources[22] = " ";

        quotes[23] = "A Taurus is a very sensual learner. Therefore, they need a multitude of educational aids, like music, video, taste, touch and smell. They are very hands on, and learn by being exposed to the actual material they are learning about, rather than just reading about it in a textbook.";
        sources[23] = " ";

        quotes[24] = "A Taurus is very observational. They don’t even realize they are being hilarious because they take from their environment and simply build off of its momentum. They never have a problem with laughing at themselves, and are often the first to make a witty joke about something they did or a blunder they experienced.";
        sources[24] = " ";

        quotes[25] = "A Taurus loves to go on adventures, write, and act. However, they also love to do makeup and can often be found perusing the internet in need of tutorials and fun things to try out.";
        sources[25] = " ";

        quotes[26] = "Some people might call you stubborn, but you simply just know what you believe in, and that is rare these days. You are headstrong, and you have faith in your mind and your emotions. Don’t let anyone tell you how to think or feel. You’re extremely intelligent, you are strong, and when you trust yourself you are unstoppable. Keep pushing yourself to make all of those beautiful dreams a reality.";
