        quotes[0] = "Gemini are commonly associated with twins because of the dual nature of their personality. They are inconsistent and indecisive due to their inner restlessness. However, they are also adaptable and capable of adjusting to whatever new challenges are thrown their way. This is because they are deeply inquisitive and are constantly searching for an understanding of the world. Overall, Gemini welcome any and all challenges because they cannot stand repetition or any semblance of boredom.";
        sources[0] = "Patrick Algrim";

        quotes[1] = "Their dislike of boredom extends to their social life. Gemini always need to be moving and will lose interest in a conversation if it doesn’t flow fast enough. ‘The Lovers’ card is commonly associated with them because verbal communication is immensely important in their friendships, careers, and relationships.";
        sources[1] = "Patrick Algrim";

        quotes[2] = "Gemini love exchanging ideas and can hold a conversation with anyone they meet. Because they are social butterflies who are always ready for a conversation, they dislike being alone. They would rather be surrounded by other people and keeping themselves busy, which is why they are fans of networking, multitasking, and problem-solving.";
        sources[2] = "Patrick Algrim";

        quotes[3] = "Gemini’s mind and mouth are always moving at lightning speed because they are ruled by Mercury, which is the planet of communication. Gemini can absorb a lot of information at any given time because they are quick-witted and mentally flexible. However, they have a cool detachment to their surroundings. They base all of their decisions on logic and reason. Because of this, when Mercury is in Gemini you will be more focused on facts and data than big, philosophical questions.";
        sources[3] = "Patrick Algrim";

        quotes[4] = "The influence of the planet will also make you feel fickle and fidgety. At this time, you are going to feel more distracted than usual. You won’t be able to focus on a single thought for long. Instead, you are going to have a million different ideas, but you aren’t going to follow through on any of them. This is because Gemini are curious, inquisitive, and talkative. They like to think, talk, listen and learn more than they like to take action. This is why they commonly become skilled in many different areas instead of focusing on mastering a single one.";
        sources[4] = "Patrick Algrim";

        quotes[5] = "People who are born under the influence of air signs, such as Geminis, will instantly notice every single thing in their surroundings. Since they are so perceptive, they are able to put themselves in other people’s shoes easily. On the plus side, this makes it easy for them to cooperate and communicate with others. However, being able to predict what everyone wants from them can also lead them toward people-pleasing. Since Gemini want a better world, it is tempting for them to try to please everyone in their personal and professional lives, which can cause burnout.";
        sources[5] = "Patrick Algrim";

        quotes[6] = "Although Gemini are social creatures, they still need plenty of space. They do not enjoy being tied down. They need the freedom to do whatever spontaneous action pops into their mind. They cannot handle confinement because it makes them feel restless. It makes them feel suffocated. Like air, you can never catch them.";
        sources[6] = "Patrick Algrim";

        quotes[7] = "Geminis are excellent communicators in both verbal and written form. While this is often a positive trait that draws people to them, it can also mean they are persuasive, coercive, and skilled at lying. Their two-faced personality, which causes them to switch back and forth on ideas and important issues, can cause confusion amongst their peers. Additionally, since they get bored easily in romantic relationships, friendships, and careers, they are often switching life paths and starting over.";
        sources[7] = "Patrick Algrim";

        quotes[8] = "Luckily, Geminis go with the flow. They are open-minded about whatever challenges await them. Their main concern is having fun and enjoying the moment, so they aren’t going to dwell on what is behind them. They are much more focused on the present than the past or even the future, partially because what they wanted yesterday has no bearing on what they might want tomorrow. Their dreams are as unpredictable as their moods.";
        sources[8] = "Patrick Algrim";

        quotes[9] = "Although Geminis are chatty, it is difficult for them to express their emotions. Instead of talking about their innermost feelings, they cope using cynical humor and avoidance techniques. They will commonly turn weighty, negative conversations into more lighthearted conversations because they are uncomfortable with sharing emotional experiences.";
        sources[9] = "Patrick Algrim";

        quotes[10] = "When they’re upset themselves, they will do whatever is possible in order to distract themselves. Because of their inability to sit with an emotion for long, they tend to have high highs and low lows. However, they have no problem cheering up others who are upset. They are nurturing and always know the right thing to say to calm others.";
        sources[10] = "Patrick Algrim";

        quotes[11] = "When the moon is in Gemini, you are going to flit from group to group, involving yourself with a lot of different people. Even though Geminis don’t like to share their emotions, they love to gossip. They love knowing what goes on in other people’s lives. Unfortunately, they’re not good with discretion. They talk too much, which can make them come across as unreliable, like they can’t keep a secret.";
        sources[11] = "Patrick Algrim";

        quotes[12] = "Geminis are the fun friend. They are quick-witted and can keep any conversation going. Plus, they are hilarious. They can always come up with a clever joke or double entendre that will make everyone around them burst into laughter.";
        sources[12] = "Patrick Algrim";

        quotes[13] = "Geminis have large groups of friends without many close friends because they are so changeable.";
        sources[13] = "Patrick Algrim";

        quotes[14] = "Since Geminis are restless, they cannot remain in repetitive situations for long. They need to keep trying new things, keep venturing out on new adventures. They require constant stimulation. That is why they have a hard time staying focused during a conversation.";
        sources[14] = "Patrick Algrim";

        quotes[15] = "For Gemini, love doesn’t always last. They get distracted easily and hate the feeling of being tied down, so whenever they fall for someone, they worry the feeling might pass just as quickly as it arrived. Due to their fickle desires, they don’t tend to make future plans. Their spontaneity can be fun at first, but it can also make long-term relationships challenging.";
        sources[15] = "Patrick Algrim";

        quotes[16] = "If they’re upset about something or someone, they won’t make a scene of things but rather, bottle things up and will call you names under their breath.";
        sources[16] = "Patrick Algrim";

        quotes[17] = "They need a strong mental connection in their friendships and relationships or else it won’t last.";
        sources[17] = "Patrick Algrim";

        quotes[18] = "Their mind is always pulling them in a million different directions. If someone isn’t engaging their intellect, then their thoughts are going to drift off about something more captivating.";
        sources[18] = "Patrick Algrim";

        quotes[19] = "They fear boredom and don’t want to feel trapped, like they’re stuck in one place. Because of this, they prefer busy scenes where they can meet new people and engage in new experiences.";
        sources[19] = "Patrick Algrim";
