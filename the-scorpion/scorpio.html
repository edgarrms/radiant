        quotes[0] = "Scorpios will sting you if you treat them with disrespect. They are one of the most honest signs of the zodiac who don’t have any patience for lying, cheating, or stealing. They tell the truth and expect the people surrounding them to do the same. Even small infractions will bother them. They don’t have any time for mixed signals, dating games, or toxic people.";
        sources[0] = "Patrick Algrim";

        quotes[1] = "This star sign is only comfortable when they are the ones in control. They aren’t good at seeing both sides of a situation or coming to compromises because they are determined to get their way. They are stubborn, obsessive, and self-proclaimed control freaks.";
        sources[1] = "Patrick Algrim";

        quotes[2] = "Since they know exactly what they want, they are not going to give up on their goals easily. They are not going to change their opinion easily, either. They feel intensely, so you shouldn’t expect them to back down from an argument or alter what they believe in.";
        sources[2] = "Patrick Algrim";

        quotes[3] = "Scorpio is the only zodiac that is ruled by 2 planets, Mars and Pluto — maybe that’s why they’re such an intense sign!";
        sources[3] = "Patrick Algrim";

        quotes[4] = "A Scorpio ruled under Mars has the power and determination to be self-made and go after the things they want most out of life.";
        sources[4] = "Patrick Algrim";

        quotes[5] = "Weirdly enough though, Scorpios hate not being in control, so putting their faith in fate or destiny is not something they like to do.";
        sources[5] = "Patrick Algrim";

        quotes[6] = "Scorpios are determined, passionate, and single-minded. They stay hyper-focused whenever they have their mindset on something. Since they believe anything is possible, they set high goals for themselves. They don’t have any limits.";
        sources[6] = "Patrick Algrim";

        quotes[7] = "Even if they suffer from a setback or a failure, Scorpios won’t let it get them down for long. They will bounce back quickly and try again. They aren’t quitters. They keep going because they know their end result will be worth all of the efforts they are exerting.";
        sources[7] = "Patrick Algrim";

        quotes[8] = "Scorpios need to feel like they are in control over every single situation — and over their own emotions. They never show their vulnerability in public. Even some of their loved ones, who have known them their entire lives, have never seen them with tears in their eyes.";
        sources[8] = "Patrick Algrim";

        quotes[9] = "They try to keep their emotions to themselves and cry behind closed doors. Scorpios don’t trust people easily, so they don’t want to give anyone ammo to use against them in the future. They don’t want to appear weak.";
        sources[9] = "Patrick Algrim";

        quotes[10] = "A Scorpio is one of the most intense signs and is known for having mood swings, just as water signs are susceptible to it too. Those with this element are more intuitive and psychic too, which makes sense because Scorpio is ruled by Pluto, the planet of psychic energy!";
        sources[10] = "Patrick Algrim";

        quotes[11] = "Scorpios aren’t a stranger to mood swings. They feel all of their emotions with strong intensity. This makes them fun to be around when they’re in a good mood. However, it makes them a danger when they are in a bad mood. They have a short temper and are prone to small acts of violence. They get incredibly jealous when other people reach personal and professional achievements before them. Everything is a competition to them — and they don’t like to lose.";
        sources[11] = "Patrick Algrim";

        quotes[12] = "Scorpios do not give up easily. A few speed bumps aren’t going to cause them to walk away from someone special. They are problem solvers, so they will work toward fixing whatever is wrong.";
        sources[12] = "Patrick Algrim";

        quotes[13] = "Scorpios simply aren’t interested in casual relationships. They prefer serious relationships that are built to last. Although it takes them a long time to open up to other people, they form deep emotional connections. They will show up for a partner, family member, or friend whenever they are in need, no questions asked. They are loyal. They are committed. They are excellent partners.";
        sources[13] = "Patrick Algrim";

        quotes[14] = "Scorpios are confident, brave, and independent. They feel like they don’t need anyone else because they are perfectly capable of taking care of themselves. Even when they enter a committed relationship or develop close friendships, they still like to have their space. They don’t want to feel smothered, and don’t want to feel like they needed another person to survive. They would rather work on a task themselves, so they know it’s done the right way and they don’t end up disappointed. They prefer to have full control.";
        sources[14] = "Patrick Algrim";

        quotes[15] = "Scorpios can sometimes have trouble keeping friends because of their rapid, unexpected mood swings. Not everyone appreciates their brutal, uncensored honesty and combative personality. It doesn’t help that as soon as someone gets on their bad side, a Scorpio will not hesitate to leave them in the past.";
        sources[15] = "Patrick Algrim";

        quotes[16] = "If someone sticks by a Scorpio, they will be a loyal friend. They will keep any secrets you tell them and they will be the first to volunteer to help with difficult tasks, whether you are moving into a new apartment, want a designated driver, or simply need someone to listen to you vent.";
        sources[16] = "Patrick Algrim";

        quotes[17] = "With the full moon in Scorpio, life can appear rocky and like things are all over the place and out of control, but that just means breakthroughs and transformation are happening and new beginnings are on their way.";
        sources[17] = "Patrick Algrim";

        quotes[18] = "Scorpios are mysterious. They build walls around themselves in order to keep other people at an arm’s length. Of course, this doesn’t mean they are anti-social. They actually make great friends because they will listen more than they speak. They will encourage the other person to vent about their fears and their feelings without passing judgment. However, they won’t volunteer any information about themselves. They will always redirect the conversation back toward you.";
        sources[18] = "Patrick Algrim";

        quotes[19] = "Since Scorpios spend more time listening than speaking, they are masters of keeping secrets. They are not going to gossip with everyone at work or school. They are not going to spread rumors. They keep their knowledge to themselves.";
        sources[19] = "Patrick Algrim";

        quotes[20] = "Scorpios are detail-oriented. They have big goals for their future, so they are constantly thinking ten steps ahead. Unfortunately, they assume everyone else has secret intentions, so they are careful about who they trust — especially in the workplace. They are ambitious and highly competitive, so they will fight dirty in order to get to the top. They will make sure that they earn what they believe they deserve because they don’t want their hard work to be for nothing. ";
        sources[20] = "Patrick Algrim";

        quotes[21] = "Scorpios don’t react well to peer pressure. If you give them enough time and space, they will eventually open up to you. However, if you push them to move faster than they are comfortable with moving, they are going to grow to resent you. Instead of drawing them closer, you are only going to push them away, because they are going to assume you are unable to respect their boundaries. They are going to assume you are trying to wrest control from them – and they aren’t going to let that happen.";
        sources[21] = "Patrick Algrim";

        quotes[22] = "Scorpios tend to clash with other dominant personalities. They don’t want to be around anyone who is going to fight for their rightful position as the leader. However, they always appreciate genuine, reliable people. They surround themselves with caring, considerate friends who they can count on during an emergency or any random afternoon. They also like being around hard workers who understand their own determination and desire for success.";
        sources[22] = "Patrick Algrim";

        quotes[23] = "Scorpios have a confidence that borders on cockiness. However, it typically works to their advantage. Because of their strong drive to succeed, they never give up hope. Whenever they are met with a problem, they fix it instead of dwelling on what went wrong. Scorpios are survivors. Even when they go through hell, they will always pick themselves up from the floor and try again. Nothing is going to keep them down for long.";
        sources[23] = "Patrick Algrim";

        quotes[24] = "Scorpios aren’t big fans of change. They don’t like being thrown into new, unpredictable situations. Although they are fearless, they prefer having all of the facts upfront. That way, they will feel more in control of the situation. When they are out of their element, and know they aren’t going to be able to get through the day without asking for help, their self-esteem takes a hit. They start to panic. They don’t like feeling helpless. They don’t like wondering whether their own fate is out of their control.";
