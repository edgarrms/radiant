        quotes[0] = "Rams symbolize determination, initiation, and leadership. They are a perfect representation of Aries because people who are born under this sign are natural leaders. They would much rather take charge of a situation than be given instructions. They prefer to be the ones setting the rules than obeying the rules. They are leaders, not followers. ";
        sources[0] = "Patrick Algrim";

        quotes[1] = "Rams can also symbolize power, force, drive, and fearlessness. They are too adventurous to play it safe. They would rather live an exciting, passionate life than a mundane, predictable one. The reason Aries are so unafraid of taking risks is that they walk through life with blind optimism. They assume that they can handle anything thrown at them, and due to their impulsive nature, they don’t think far ahead and consider consequences. They would rather act spontaneously in the moment than plan out their future.";
        sources[1] = "Patrick Algrim";

        quotes[2] = "Aries are assertive. They speak their minds instead of holding their tongue. They aren’t going to sit quietly when someone treats them poorly, and due to their protective nature, they aren’t going to keep quiet when someone else is getting treated unfairly, either. Although their temper fizzles out quickly, Aries are stubborn, persistent, and confident in their opinions. It’s never a good idea to butt heads with them when they are upset, because they won’t back down from an argument.";
        sources[2] = "Patrick Algrim";

        quotes[3] = "When Mars is in retrograde, conflicts aren’t going to be productive. Instead of getting into heated debates, it’s better for Aries to be introspective and reflective. Unfortunately, during retrograde, Aries will feel more uncertainty than they’re used to experiencing. Their desire can drop, and they can lose momentum on important projects. They might feel like they have become stagnant and get restless. This is a frustrating, challenging time for the sign.";
        sources[3] = "Patrick Algrim";

        quotes[4] = "Aries are passionate, fiery, and enthusiastic. They pour their whole heart and soul into whatever they set out to accomplish. They have a zest for life and their enthusiasm can be inspiring. However, because they are always on the lookout for the next great adventure, they hate doing mundane, repetitive chores. They feel restless when life becomes too predictable.";
        sources[4] = "Patrick Algrim";

        quotes[5] = "Aries, like all fire elements, rely on their gut instincts. They are always confident they will make the right decision, even if they don’t entirely think those decisions through before taking action. While they are spontaneous and impulsive, they are also self-sufficient. They can take care of themselves and feel like they always know best. This is why they often clash with water elements that make them feel claustrophobic and tied down. They are independent and wish to remain that way.";
        sources[5] = "Patrick Algrim";

        quotes[6] = "Aries don’t believe in good or bad timing. If there’s something they want, then they aren’t going to remain patient and wait for the right moment to strike. They are going to chase after what they want without hesitation. They are unafraid of taking risks, leaving their comfort zones, or making the first move.";
        sources[6] = "Patrick Algrim";

        quotes[7] = "The downside to their go-getter, take-charge personality is that they have trouble with authority. When they aren’t in a position of power, they feel confined. They don’t like being told what to do and can react aggressively when someone gives them orders. This can cause trouble in both their workspaces and romantic relationships. Aries also cannot stand inactivity. They get bored easily, so their passion often flicks from activity to activity, or person to person. They aren’t able to stay in one place, or mindset, for long.";
        sources[7] = "Patrick Algrim";

        quotes[8] = "Although Aries commonly pretend nothing can hurt them, they are one of the most emotional zodiac signs. They feel the excitement, sadness, anger, and every other emotion with extreme intensity. That is why it’s difficult for them to remain calm when they have been wronged.";
        sources[8] = "Patrick Algrim";

        quotes[9] = "Luckily, the intense anger that an Aries feels when something doesn’t go their way will not last for long. They rarely hold grudges because they are distracted easily. Their emotions can change in an instant, which is why they are frequently labeled as moody. They can be furious one moment and then filled with laughter the next. Their flares of anger are only temporary, but while they last, they are fierce.";
        sources[9] = "Patrick Algrim";

        quotes[10] = "At first, Aries tend to rub others the wrong way with their straightforward attitude. They are blunt about how they feel and what they want, because they don’t see the benefit in beating around the bush. Unfortunately, not everyone appreciates how direct they are, so it is often difficult for them to collaborate with others. Plus, since they are independent and highly competitive, they prefer to work solo. They would rather be busy than bored, so they are hyper-focused on their goals.";
        sources[10] = "Patrick Algrim";

        quotes[11] = "In astrology, you have a Venus sign, which represents all things love and passion. For this sign in Aries, you are protective, bold, and know what you want and aren’t afraid to go after it. You’re fierce, radiant, and have beautiful charisma about you, especially when it comes to love and dating. On the more negative side, you can tend to be a bit overbearing and refuse to slow down every once in a while, because you just love constant excitement in your life!";
        sources[11] = "Patrick Algrim";

        quotes[12] = "An Aries sign will tell it like it is — they aren’t afraid to speak the truth and speak their mind! They are naturally open people.";
        sources[12] = "Patrick Algrim";

        quotes[13] = "They have little to no patience for things or people that don’t suit them or make their life better.";
        sources[13] = "Patrick Algrim";

        quotes[14] = "An Aries sign tends to be physically active, fit, and good at sports. This makes sense because they are represented by the god of war, after all!";
        sources[14] = "Patrick Algrim";

        quotes[15] = "If you have Aries in Jupiter in your zodiac chart, you typically come on strong and confident and will go after the things you want most in life. You will always reach for the stars!";
        sources[15] = "Patrick Algrim";

        quotes[16] = "As a fire sign, an Aries lover will be very passionate and enthusiastic about all things. An Aries star sign (or sun sign) often appear to be larger than life and want to go wild and meet everyone and do everything, which doesn’t correlate well with water elements, who are more chill and keep to themselves. Talk about a sun sign taking on a hot energy!";
        sources[16] = "Patrick Algrim";

        quotes[17] = "If you hurt them or do something that rubs them the wrong way, they’ll let you know–they’re not afraid to tell you the brutal truth.";
        sources[17] = "Patrick Algrim";

        quotes[18] = "An Aries isn’t going to give you subtle hints when they’re upset. They’re unafraid of confrontation, so they are going to approach you and outline exactly what you’ve done face-to-face. This is why they’ve earned a reputation as hot-heads.";
        sources[18] = "Patrick Algrim";

        quotes[19] = "They have the confidence to follow through on any bright ideas that pop into their head. They never hold themselves back due to fear of the unknown. In fact, they thrive on unpredictability. They make their own luck and create their own opportunities.";
