        quotes[0] = "Pisces love playing the role of the savior. They are generous, selfless, and compassionate. Plus, they are people pleasers. They cannot stand knowing that someone they care about (or a complete stranger) is in a bad mood. They always put the happiness of others before their own happiness. They will do anything to make sure the people around them are comfortable. They are much more likely to lend a helping hand to one of their friends than accept help from that friend.";
        sources[0] = " ";

        quotes[1] = "Pisces have a tendency to end up in unfair, unbalanced relationships because they are uncomfortable demanding more from their partners. Their expectations are not high. They wouldn’t be able to live with themselves if they treated their loved ones unfairly, but when their loved ones treat them unfairly, they feel like there must be a good reason. They feel like they aren’t deserving of more, so they stay stuck with toxic people.";
        sources[1] = " ";

        quotes[2] = "Pisces are one of the most intuitive signs of the zodiac. They are well attuned to the emotions of their family, their friends, and everyone surrounding them. They are also in touch with their own emotions. They have intense feelings and spend a lot of time crying. Sometimes those are happy tears. However, when they are tears of anger, the pain can last a while. It takes a Pisces a long time to recover after getting hurt by someone. They aren’t a stranger to holding grudges.";
        sources[2] = " ";

        quotes[3] = "Due to their wishy-washy nature, Pisces isn’t the most logical sign. They don’t do well with careers that force them to rely on their mind alone because they prefer to act with compassion. They prefer to make decisions based on feeling alone. Pisces have a tendency to pursue wild ideas because they listen to their heart, and their gut, over their head. They aren’t afraid to dream big. However, sometimes they are afraid to follow through on those big dreams.";
        sources[3] = " ";

        quotes[4] = "Pisces are empathetic. They will listen to you rave about your accomplishments — or rant about whatever has gone wrong — for hours on end. They are the perfect person to run to when you need to cry on someone’s shoulder because they are never judgmental. That is why all of their friends run to them with problems. Pisces are always encouraging and supportive because they see a lot of potential in others. However, since they are so trusting, they can get taken advantage of easily.";
        sources[4] = " ";

        quotes[5] = "Pisces can get lost in their thoughts for hours on end because they have vivid imaginations. They are creative signs who don’t mind spending time alone because it gives them a chance to engage in escapism. They love to read, to watch television, and to listen to music so they can forget about their own lives for a while. They also love to create themselves. They are artistic and have a knack for channeling their emotions into art.";
        sources[5] = " ";

        quotes[6] = "Pisces are laid-back, adaptable, and flexible. However, this is mainly due to the fact that they are people pleasers. They care more about the way other people are feeling than how they are feeling themselves. Because they are so selfless, they will do whatever they can in order to make others more comfortable, even if it means sacrificing their own comfort in the process. Although they are trying to do the right thing, sometimes it can backfire on them and make them feel miserable and alone. ";
        sources[6] = " ";

        quotes[7] = "Pisces don’t have a strong sense of identity because they are strongly impacted by the people surrounding them. They are easily swayed by peer pressure and the opinions of their family and friends. Some might consider them gullible because they want to believe everything they are told. More than that, they want to believe the people surrounding them have good intentions. It never crosses their mind that someone could be lying to them.";
        sources[7] = " ";

        quotes[8] = "Pisces hate being criticized and get moody when things don’t go their way. They always choose to see the best in people, so if someone offends them or lies to them, it catches them off guard. They do not see the betrayal coming, which makes it even harder for them to cope with what happened. Although this sign is generally open and unguarded, if they get hurt too many times in a row, they might close themselves off emotionally in order to protect themselves.";
        sources[8] = " ";

        quotes[9] = "Pisces develop strong emotional ties with their friends and family because they soak up other people’s feelings. When one of their loved ones is hurting, they are hurting. When one of their loved ones is celebrating, they are celebrating. Pisces never turn accomplishments into a competition. There isn’t a jealous bone in their body. They are genuinely happy to see their peers succeed. They like seeing other people happy. It brings them comfort.";
        sources[9] = " ";

        quotes[10] = "Pisces are sensitive. They feel all of their emotions intensely, which is why you don’t want to get on their bad side. Although they are not bitter or vindictive, they will never forgive you for hurting them. They will never forget what you’ve done, either. They have a good memory and a tendency to hold a grudge. Plus, they aren’t afraid of spending long periods of time locked away in their room. They would rather spend their time alone than waste it with someone who does not respect them.";
        sources[10] = " ";

        quotes[11] = "If you treat a Pisces right, you will only see their kind side. They are full of compassion and empathy for everyone they meet. They never want to cause any harm. They only want to spread joy. This sign falls in love easily because they see the best in people. They focus on the positive. They pay much more attention to the potential of their partners than the shortcomings of their partners. They are romantics at heart. They make loyal partners and loyal friends.";
        sources[11] = " ";

        quotes[12] = "Pisces are good at making friends because they genuinely care about the well-being of other people. It’s obvious that they aren’t playing pretend when they offer advice or lend a helping hand. They are authentic, honest souls. Plus, they love making other people laugh. They aim to bring happiness wherever they go. They cannot stand seeing someone upset and will always act as a shoulder to lean on. They are there whenever their friends need them.";
        sources[12] = " ";

        quotes[13] = "Pisces cannot handle too much socialization at once. As much as they appreciate communicating with other people, they need time to themselves. After a big party or a long week at work, they need time to reset. They often do this by putting in earbuds and blasting their favorite music or by reading a book and getting lost in a fantasy world. Pisces are suckers for escapism. They love being able to daydream about other people and places. ";
        sources[13] = " ";

        quotes[14] = "Pisces love playing the role of the knight in shining armor. They will sacrifice anything and everything in order to support the person they love the most. They believe that if they care about someone, they should be willing to go to the end of the earth for that person. However, sometimes this dramatic way of thinking can hurt them. They are highly susceptible to ending up in toxic relationships where the other person barely lifts a finger. There’s a chance they could end up accepting far less than they deserve.";
        sources[14] = " ";

        quotes[15] = "isces rarely stop to consider the worst-case scenario before entering a new situation. They are dreamers, so it’s much more likely that they will think about everything that could go right. They have faith everything is going to turn out okay in the end, so it’s easy for them to go with the flow. They don’t stress over small things. However, since they are so positive, sometimes they are unprepared for the reality of a situation. Sometimes they don’t realize what they are getting themselves into.";
        sources[15] = " ";

        quotes[16] = "Pisces men are going to prioritize your happiness over their own. They are going to do anything they can to cheer you up when you are upset, and they are going to cheer you on whenever you celebrate an accomplishment. These men will try their hardest to make you laugh, because there is nothing they love more than seeing a smile on your face. The last thing they want is to be the reason why you are upset, so they will never stop putting effort into the relationship. They will never stop expressing how much they care.";
        sources[16] = " ";

        quotes[17] = "Pisces men live to please others, so they aren’t going to be annoyed when you ask them for help with a favor. In fact, they would be more uncomfortable if you didn’t need them for anything. They like feeling helpful. They like saving the day. Of course, they don’t want their kindness to get taken advantage of by the wrong people. They don’t want to offer love without getting even a little bit of love in return.";
        sources[17] = " ";

        quotes[18] = "Pisces women are romantic. Although they would never come right out and ask for jewelry or flowers or a homemade meal, they would be excited to receive any gift. They would appreciate it more than words can describe. These women also love to laugh. They don’t want a partner who takes themselves too seriously and they don’t want a partner who complains too much. They want to be with someone who will let loose and have fun on a daily basis.";
        sources[18] = " ";

        quotes[19] = "Pisces women are trusting. Sometimes they are too trusting. They will believe every word that comes out of your mouth. They will assume you have their best interest in heart — unless you prove otherwise. If you blatantly hurt them, then they aren’t going to forgive you. They aren’t going to accept your apology and move on as if everything is perfectly fine. If you break their trust, you will probably lose them forever because they aren’t going to forget what you’ve done anytime soon.";
