        quotes[0] = "Libras strive for equality. They believe everyone has a right for their voices to be heard. They are mediators who simply want justice to be served. However, they are not fans of confrontation. They try their hardest to keep the peace within their social circles and want everyone to get along. They grow uncomfortable whenever there is tension in a room and will try to defuse the situation as quickly as possible. Because of their strong moral code, they make excellent judges, lawyers, and diplomats.";
        sources[0] = "Patrick Algrim";

        quotes[1] = "In order to reach true happiness, Libras need balance. They are going to feel overwhelmed if the scales are tipped too far to one side, so they try their best to find a balance between their career and social life. They don’t want to work too many hours and feel like their entire existence revolves around their job. However, they don’t want to spend so much time relaxing and having fun that their life loses its sense of purpose, either. They want to find the perfect balance between work and play.";
        sources[1] = "Patrick Algrim";

        quotes[2] = "A Libra sign cares deeply about their appearances. Although they genuinely believe that their friends and family are worth so much more than what is on the surface, personally, they invest a lot of money into their clothing and other material items. Libras can sometimes come across as superficial because they have such expensive taste. They always want the most luxurious items money can afford. Anyone who falls under this star sign is certainly not a stranger to self-care. They will splurge on anything, no matter how vain, if they know it’s going to bring them joy.";
        sources[2] = "Patrick Algrim";

        quotes[3] = "Libras have a good sense of taste when it comes to books, art, music, and travel destinations. Surrounding themselves with beautiful places and things enriches their life. It inspires them to create. It brings them a sense of peace. Luckily, Libras are also picky. Their indecisiveness ends up saving them a lot of money because they can spend large periods of time debating which object they should purchase. Since they will not settle for anything less than the best, this means they will sometimes opt not to purchase anything at all.";
        sources[3] = "Patrick Algrim";

        quotes[4] = "Libras can spend excessively long periods of time weighing the pros and cons of a situation because they want to make everyone happy. They are people pleasers at heart. They don’t want to be the reason why anyone is upset. Whenever something goes wrong, they are quick to come to a compromise. They are willing to sacrifice what they want in order to make someone else happy. This is because they commonly put other people before themselves. They don’t rank high on their own list of priorities.";
        sources[4] = "Patrick Algrim";

        quotes[5] = "Although Libras are good communicators, they hate confrontation, so it’s rare for them to express annoyance with another person. It is much more likely that they will act passive-aggressively. They will rely on sarcasm and backhanded compliments in order to get their point across. Although it will be obvious that they are in a bad mood, they will insist they are fine. They will expect the other person to guess what is wrong instead of exploding and causing drama they believe is unnecessary.";
        sources[5] = "Patrick Algrim";

        quotes[6] = "Libras are social butterflies. Being around other people doesn’t drain them. It energizes them. They value deep personal relationships and cannot stand being alone even for short bursts of time. That is why they are always getting groups together on weekends and holidays. They are always the one sending the first text and initiating plans. Friendships, and romantic relationships, are incredibly important to them. They cannot imagine a life without the people who matter the most to them, because those people have shaped them into who they are today.";
        sources[6] = "Patrick Algrim";

        quotes[7] = "Libras like setting plans themselves because they are natural-born leaders. They don’t mind taking the lead in situations because they are objective and fair. They can choose an activity that will make every single person in the group happy – including themselves. Plus, they are planners with excellent taste in everything, from restaurants to films. They are confident that anything they put together, whether it’s a party or small hangout session, will be fun for everyone involved.";
        sources[7] = "Patrick Algrim";

        quotes[8] = "Libras are charmers. Whether they are single or are in a committed relationship, they are big flirts – and sometimes this is entirely unintentional. It’s in their nature to try to make everyone happy. Their sweet compliments and generous favors can easily be misinterpreted. Although Libras fall hard when they fall in love, they understand it’s normal to have more than one love in their lifetime. This is why they are so pragmatic about relationships. They will leave someone, even though they care about them if the timing isn’t right. They believe most relationships, and most people, are temporary.";
        sources[8] = "Patrick Algrim";

        quotes[9] = "Although Libras are able to let the wrong people leave their life, they have a hard time allowing those same people to leave their thoughts. They will hold grudges for long periods of time – and they are pretty big gossips. If someone wronged them in the past, they will still tell the stories years later. They never feel like they deserve any of the poor treatment they receive since they have such huge, kind hearts. Unfortunately, this can lead to them drowning in their own self-pity. Once they start feeling sorry for themselves, it’s hard for them to bounce back.";
        sources[9] = "Patrick Algrim";

        quotes[10] = "Some people believe Libras have their heads in the clouds. However, they simply prefer to consider themselves dreamers. They have strong, vivid imaginations, so they tend to be skilled when it comes to music, poetry, storytelling, and other forms of creation. Since they love surrounding themselves with beautiful things creating a painting to hang on their wall or a song they can sing to their friends will bring them peace. Plus, creating also gives them a healthy outlet for expressing their pent-up emotions.";
        sources[10] = "Patrick Algrim";

        quotes[11] = "Libras don’t always deal with their feelings in such healthy ways. They can be manipulative at times – and they might not even realize they’re doing anything wrong. Since everyone loves them, they can easily use their charm in order to get their way. They can sweet talk their friends, family members, and partners without anyone catching onto what they’re doing. They are also known to flirt with people who aren’t actually interested in dating in order to get an ego boost. They don’t see the harm in what they’re doing since they’re only acting nice.";
        sources[11] = "Patrick Algrim";

        quotes[12] = "Libras are adventurous. They aren’t afraid to try new things and visit new places. Whenever a friend asks them to tag along to a restaurant or a music festival, they will agree in a heartbeat. Although they think their bigger decisions through, they are still spontaneous. The Libra energy is to have fun — and they like to watch other people having fun. Plus, they never want to disappoint someone they care about. That means if someone invites them on a road trip, they’re going to go with the flow and see where the ride takes them.";
        sources[12] = "Patrick Algrim";

        quotes[13] = "Libras never have trouble forming new friendships because they are outgoing, friendly, and social. They can keep a conversation going about any topic, even if they have just met someone minutes earlier. However, they tend to gravitate toward people who seem the most uncomfortable and help them open up because they don’t want anyone to feel alienated and alone. Their friend group tends to be quite eclectic because they can pretty much get along with anyone. People are drawn to their charm, so their friends are very diverse. They all come from completely different walks of life.";
        sources[13] = "Patrick Algrim";

        quotes[14] = "Libras crave deep, committed relationships. They can make friends everywhere they go, but while they can see the value in temporary connections, they are secretly searching for a bond that is unbreakable. Although they are comfortable being single because it gives them a chance to flirt and form new friendships, they would much rather be with one person who knows them on a core level. Plus, they are romantics at heart. They love the idea of love. There’s nothing they want more than to find someone who feels like home, someone who brings them a sense of peace.";
        sources[14] = "Patrick Algrim";

        quotes[15] = "Libras care a great deal about what other people think about them. Being in a happy relationship is not enough for them. They want others to know they are in a happy relationship. It’s the same when it comes to their friendships. They post a lot of smiling, group pictures on social media because they want the world to think of them in a positive light. They are people pleasers who cannot rest unless they feel like they are making a good impression and setting a good example.";
        sources[15] = "Patrick Algrim";

        quotes[16] = "You strive for good friendships and good relationships — ones that look good and feel good (stylish, kind personality, intelligent, well-mannered, financially stable).";
        sources[16] = "Patrick Algrim";

        quotes[17] = "There’s a magnetic attraction to you and your peaceful, harmonious personality.";
        sources[17] = "Patrick Algrim";

        quotes[18] = "Often indecisive and have no problem just going with the flow and being spontaneous!";
        sources[18] = "Patrick Algrim";

        quotes[19] = "A Libran will feel their best when they know they’re in a balanced environment and have balance and peace in their life (alone time and social time).";
